#Prompt Engineer
This repository has two main purposes. One is to demonstrate to hiring managers and other interested parties my ability to craft a prompt. The second is to provide pre-written prompts to others as I refine them.

I tend to write shorter prompts for specific tasks. As it stands currently, I find it unhelpful generating a longer prompt that entails all the things that are important for an ebook, including brainstorming, writing, marketing, publishing. This tends to confuse the LLM and it does better with smaller specific tasks.

Generally my prompt is going to end with something along the lines of, "Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and reflect for a moment before starting. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information." These are little tidbits I've picked up along the way which I have found to be very useful. The bit about asking clarifying questions has been revolutionary and saves a lot of time.
